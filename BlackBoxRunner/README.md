# Task: BlackBox Decipher

Adventurers, listen up! Your skills are needed for a crucial mission. The security team of a powerful company has intercepted a secret message, but unfortunately, it is encrypted using the mysterious [BlackBoxComponent.dll](https://github.com/Vukiz/CodingDojo/blob/master/BlackBoxRunner/BlackBoxRunner/lib/BlackBoxComponent.dll "BlackBoxComponent.dll"). However, fear not! The company has provided a console application, [Program.cs](https://github.com/Vukiz/CodingDojo/blob/master/BlackBoxRunner/BlackBoxRunner/Program.cs "Program.cs"), to aid you in your quest.

But that's not all. Thanks to our gathered surveillance data, we've compiled a list of possible words that might be used in the message. Check the [PossibleWords.txt](https://github.com/Vukiz/CodingDojo/tree/master/BlackBoxRunner "PossibleWords.txt") file to find them.

Your task is clear: use your wit and skills to create a script that can decipher the encrypted message using the [BlackBoxComponent.dll](https://github.com/Vukiz/CodingDojo/blob/master/BlackBoxRunner/BlackBoxRunner/lib/BlackBoxComponent.dll "BlackBoxComponent.dll"), and deliver the correct answer to the company. Remember, time is of the essence - the fate of this mission rests in your hands. Are you up for the challenge?
